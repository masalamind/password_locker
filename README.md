## Setup Instructions 
- Execute MAIN to run the application
- When prompted with PRESS 'y' TO PROCEED OR TYPE 'quit' TO EXIT APPLICATION: only type quit after you're done using the application.
- Entering 'y' after above prompt takes you to the main menu
- You have to sign in to see the functionality
- Main functionality found at > 2. Sign into your Mwandani Account 
- Register app(s) credentials before using other functionality: initially there are no credentials
- Recommend that the user never exits the application unless they've finished putting credentials, deleting, or viewing credentials 
- After performing an operation - user should return to main menu so that they can proceed to the next operation 
- The menu options marked :(coming soon) have not been implemented and only print statements
